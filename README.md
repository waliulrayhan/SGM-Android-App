This repository contains the source code for the **SGM Android App**, a smart grid management system designed for real-time monitoring, management, and optimization of energy distribution in a smart city using IoT technology. The Android app interfaces with a backend API to provide users with a seamless experience for managing power distribution, monitoring energy flow, and integrating renewable sources.

## Overview

The Smart Grid Management (SGM) system aims to modernize the traditional power grid by introducing IoT-based monitoring and control mechanisms. It provides:

- **Real-time data transfer**: Enables efficient decision-making based on live data.
- **Automatic power cut system**: Reduces the need for manual interventions.
- **Decentralized command system**: Ensures commands are delivered to the right entities.
- **Bi-directional power flow**: Empowers customers to generate energy and contribute to the grid.
- **Interactive AI-driven monitoring**: Predicts blackouts and optimizes grid performance.

### Features
- **Decentralized Management**: Decentralized infrastructure for higher reliability.
- **AI Integration**: Automated predictions for grid performance and blackouts.
- **Renewable Energy Support**: Seamless integration of solar and wind energy.
- **Interactive Monitoring**: Real-time dashboard to monitor grid health and performance.

## Technology Stack

- **Android (Java)**: For the mobile application.
- **Python**: Backend API that provides real-time data to the Android app. Check the [SGM Python API](https://github.com/waliulrayhan/SGM-Python-API) repository for more details.
- **IoT Devices**: Integration with IoT sensors for real-time energy data collection.
- **Machine Learning**: Used for energy demand predictions and grid failure forecasts.

## Installation

### Android App
To run the Android application:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/waliulrayhan/SGM-Android-App.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the project on an emulator or physical device.

### Backend API
The Android app relies on a Python-based API that provides real-time grid management data. You can find the API here: [SGM Python API](https://github.com/waliulrayhan/SGM-Python-API).

Follow the instructions in that repository to set up the API.
